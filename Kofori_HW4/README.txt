CS 171 HW 4
       The purpose of this homework is to help the student practice the concept of inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism and, overriding methods in java class. The homework comes with two java class files named Person and Home4Work which are to help the student test their code. The concept inheritance in OOP is the ability for another class to have access to elements of another separate class. With the help of inheritance, methods from that class could be overridden and implemented to a specific desire in another class.
       The base class in this exercise is the License which have instance variables holder (owner of the specific license), the license number (long datatype) and expiration date to tell when the license could no longer be used of for the intended purpose. License can also tell different licenses from one another by comparing their names and license numbers. Another subclass, DriversLicense inherits the elements of the base License class to implement its methods. The DriversLicense inherits all of the elements and instantiates another variable state in order to differentiate a state in which one’s driver’s license was awarded. This is a very useful method which was inherited from the base license class with the help of the ‘extend’ keyword. 
       Another subclass TruckDriversLicense also inherits from the base class License and DriversLicense license. This License is a special kind of License for TruckDrivers and enables them to drive vehicles with a maximum weight of up to 26000lbs. Another subclass FishingLicense inherits the main base class License and hence grants people the freedom to fish certain types of fish.
